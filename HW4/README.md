I still need to work on understanding variables and functions a bit better. I understand them in theory, but implementing them correctly is a different question. I think if I just practice working with them more, it'll click eventually. 
I'm glad that I actually got the choices to work, because it was a lot of trial and error; troubleshooting things until it worked.
After doing my own coding, I had ChatGPT do the assignment prompt. I looked at the code, and used it as an example/reference for how to make my code better. Particularly when it came to getting the buttons to cycle new options. It was useful in that way.
I still think the flaw about using AI to code is that you're not actually learning how to do it. I think it should be used as a reference at most.
